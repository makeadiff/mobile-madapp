        <div class="panel-heading"> 1. What is the difference between MADApp and Mobile MADApp?</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            MADApp is a web portal to manage volunteer and student data in the MAD system. It is used to assign students, teachers and mentors to a particular class in a shelter. The data updation in MADApp is typically a one time activity at beginning of the year. While Mobile MADApp is a mobile compatible tool to enter qualitative class data on a week on week basis.

        <div class="panel-body">
            - Ask the CH to ensure that he/she has done the batch allocation for all volunteers and students on MADApp<br>
            - Ask the Shelter Support Fellow (SSF) to ensure that a Class Start Date is assigned for the particular shelter. All classes that have already occurred post this date should appear on Mobile MADApp after this is done. <a href="http://makeadiff.in/madapp/tutorial/set_center_start_date/">Here</a> is a tutorial for the SS Fellow to follow.

        <div class="panel-heading">  3. I am unable to login to my Mobile MADApp account. What to do?</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            There are two ways to approach this problem:<br>
            - Ensure that the volunteer is using the same Email ID that was used to register him/her into MAD and  password as pass to login. If that doesnâ€™t work, then..<br>
            - Get in touch the city HC fellow to see if the volunteer data has been updated correctly on MADApp. <a href="http://makeadiff.in/madapp/tutorial/fix_invalid_login/">Here</a> is a tutorial for HC fellow to follow<br><br>

          <div class="panel-heading">  4. I seem to have forgotten my Mobile MADApp password, how do I reset it?</div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            The password for MADApp and Mobile MADApp are always the same. By default, both tools have password set as pass. Mobile MADApp currently does not have a "forgot password" option. But you can reset the password using forgot password option of MADApp by checking <a href="http://makeadiff.in/madapp">this link</a>

            <div class="panel-heading">  5. I cannot see the student names from my class in Mobile MADApp. What is wrong?</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                - It is possible that the student data does not exist on MADApp yet. Ask the CH to check whether he/she has updated the student data. Check <a href="http://makeadiff.in/madapp/tutorial/class_allocation/">this tutorial</a> for ESF to add student and class data<br>
                - It is also possible that the student data might have been deleted for some reasons. Ask the CH to check in MADApp whether the student data is present or not.

            <div class="panel-body">
                Ask the CH/ESF to make a change in MADApp. The changes should reflect within 24 hours

            <div class="panel-heading">    7. I cannot see the data I entered after my class last week anymore. Where did the data go?</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                This could happen due to two reasons:<br>
                - If Net connection was disrupted while entering and saving class details, the data might have been lost.<br>
                - If the volunteer forgot to click on the <b>SAVE</b> button at the end of the page after entering data, the data might have been lost.<br>
                A good practice for all volunteers after entering and saving data is to ensure that you receive the <b>"Information Updated"</b> notification. One can then be sure that data was saved properly
